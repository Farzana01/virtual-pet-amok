Virtual-pet-amok

This program has two types of pets. They are either organic or robotic. 

We are expected to model a shelter that houses both dogs and cats. They are either robotic or organic. 
Organic pets behave the same way as live animals- they feed, walk, play and soil cages. 
Robotic pets only play and maintenance is required if running low on oil.

There are two test methods to check if the prgram is running without any errors.

Popo, the koala is the new type of pet in the shelter. Now, the shelter is offering the user to treat the pet of his or her choice. 
The chart shows if the pets are treated and taken care of the proper way.
