Virtual-Pet-Amok

Virtual-pet-amok

This program has two types of pets. They are either organic or robotic. 

The files are:
Cat - abstract class
Dog - abstract class
OrganicPet - interface
OrgCat - inheritance
OrgDog - inheritance
RoboCat - inheritance
RoboDog - inheritance
RoboticPet - interface
VirtualPet - abstract class which houses all abstract methods
VirtualPetApp - main method
VirtualPetShelter - contains one Map of Virtual pet

We are expected to model a shelter that houses both dogs and cats. They are either robotic or organic. Organic pets behave the same way as live animals- they feed, walk, play and soil cages. Robotic pets only play and maintenance is required if running low on oil.

All classes have encapsulared instance variables. They have visibility modifiers to methods only used internally.
